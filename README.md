# RSS-Entries - IMM Fork
Craft CMS plugin to create entries from RSS feeds

## Usage

Install the plugin on your Craft setup. Create a entry type with a field called 'description'. Select that channel and enter a RSS feed. Click 'Run Now'.

Fields are hard-coded for IMM needs.

## Future Plans

- Scheduling tasks for refreshing every few hours is in the plans
- Select different fields to enter the data into (other than 'description'
- Delete entries before inserting new ones.
